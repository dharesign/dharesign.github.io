# Employment History

## Senior Software Engineer, [Bloomberg L.P.][2], New York, USA <small>May 2014&ndash;Present</small>

### UI Infrastructure <small>May 2014&ndash;Present</small>

I am currently working as part of the UI Infrastructure team. We are
responsible for building the platform and toolkit used by thousands of other
developers at Bloomberg to write customer-facing applications. We own the
server-side and client-side execution environments, along with a custom UI
toolkit that facilitates rapid financial application development. We design and
implement high performance UI systems, primarily in C++ and JavaScript, that
integrate efficiently with real-time data and have user-friendly APIs. We are
responsible for implementing programmer-facing tools and deployment mechanisms
for debugging, profiling, and releasing applications.

## Senior Software Engineer, [Bloomberg L.P.][2], London, UK <small>September 2008&ndash;May 2014</small>

### Real-Time Applications <small>February 2012&ndash;May 2014</small>

As part of an 8-person team, I was responsible for building worksheet
components to display market data monitoring in real time. These worksheets are
considered essential by the majority of our terminal subscribers who use them
as the core of personalized work flows. Such work flows are made possible by
the worksheets' ability to integrate and communicate with numerous other
components that make up The Bloomberg Professional Service.

As the owners of a flagship product the team is integral in maintaining
Bloomberg's competitive edge, and are heavily involved in realizing the future
vision of the Bloomberg Professional Service. Day to day tasks involved the
specification, design, development, and integration of new features, working on
projects to add or improve integration with other components and functional
areas, plus the maintenance of the existing offering. I worked closely with our
business development representatives to identify and develop
opportunities&mdash;including visiting clients to observe and advise&mdash;and
also with our customer support desk to diagnose and solve issues.

### FX/Commodity Derivatives <small>November 2008&ndash;February 2012</small>

Working in a sub-team of 4 developers, as part of the larger 25-strong
derivatives team in London, I was responsible for the pricing and market data
side of Bloomberg's FX Option valuation screen. During my three-and-a-half
years, I worked on a variety of projects, including: UI design and
implementation; integrating new pricing models, written by the NY-based quant
team; introducing new option strategies into the system; SQL query
optimization; redesigning the pricing and market data frameworks to be more
scalable; performance improvements.

### Financial Software Developer Training <small>September 2008&ndash;November 2008</small>

8-week training course on C, C++, JavaScript, and proprietary Bloomberg
technologies.

## Software Engineer, [HGL Dynamics][3], Godalming, UK <small>January 2008&ndash;September 2008</small>
Working in a team of 7 other developers, I was responsible for the development
of analysis software for the Aerospace Testing industry. The applications were
based on a client-server design, utilizing object-oriented paradigms. I
developed a number of base components for re-use in later projects.
